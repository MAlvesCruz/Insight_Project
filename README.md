### The best fit for your needs

Consulting project with a former Brazilian Q&A website.

## Problem

Nowadays one can find many websites to ask questions and get the information that is needed. However, many of these services are provided only in English. Also, the idea behind a Q&A website is that anyone can, in priciple, reply to a particular question. 
Back in 2011, a Brazilian Q&A website, was launched with the purpose of finding people with the "right" knowledge to provide the best answers to those seeking certain information. 

Because at the time there was no (or limited) association of tags and keywords to a question and/or user, the recommendation system of the website presented some issues.


## Solution

In order to make a better recommendation system, Natural Language Processing is going to be applied to the archive data. The archive data contain information regarding all the questions that were ever asked in the website:

1) The question body
2) The time it was created
3) The time it was answered
4) Which users answered the question
